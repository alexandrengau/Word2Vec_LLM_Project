# Word2Vec - LLM Project

## IASD Master Program 2023/2024 - PSL Research University

### About this project

This project is the second homework assignment for the LLM class of the IASD (Artificial Intelligence, Systems and Data) Master Program 2023/2024, at PSL Research University (Université PSL).

The project at hand involves the implementation of Word2Vec in Python, a technique utilized for both natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLM). Additionally, it delves into an analysis of a classification task using a convolutional model.

## General information
